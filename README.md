# Hey, I'm jakkie üëäüèæ

I'm a data person, crypto hustler, and physics fan on a mission to dominate DeFi and trading. I‚Äôm all about seizing opportunities, staying creative, and mastering unconventional strategies.

## What I Do

- **Professional Work:**  
  I design and build low-latency crypto trading infrastructure and develop automated trading bots. My work focuses on processing vast amounts of blockchain data in real time, ensuring ultra-fast trade execution and robust trading strategies.

- **Crypto Trading & DeFi:**  
  I break down on-chain data from DEXes, AMMs, and various crypto protocols, transforming raw blockchain information into actionable insights. I'm constantly iterating on innovative trading strategies.

- **Data & Physics:**  
  Merging data science with a passion for physics (think entropy and econophysics), I uncover patterns and insights that help inform smarter trading decisions.

- **Tech & Projects:**  
  Whether it's a real-time indexer, a historical backtester, or an experimental machine learning model for trading, I build tools that turn complex data into clear, actionable intelligence.

## Projects

- **[Solana DeFi Trade Indexer:](https://github.com/iamjakkie/Solana-dex-swap-listener)**  
  A real-time tool that decodes and processes on-chain swap transactions from platforms like Raydium, Meteora, Orca, and others. I also added a historical backfill capability there, just set the range of blocks you want to get and voila, you just scraped (almost) all trades from main DEXes on Solana using just a RPC node... As of march 2025, the total cost would be around $50/m for QN solana node (no need for geyser plugin)... Do your own math, compare it against Dune or Flipside which vendor lock-in and total lack of usability for trading purposes ;) Data is saved into Avro by default (fast). This piece also contains a preprocessor that takes all the avros and produces a single trades parquet file per exchange per symbol - super easy to use by a backtester.

- **[Backtester Engine:](https://github.com/iamjakkie/Backtester)**  
  Systems that ingest, enrich, and analyze historical data to backtest trading strategies and refine models. heavy WIP.

- **[Automated Trading Bots:](https://github.com/iamjakkie/pro_crypto_algo_bots/blob/main/README.md)**  
  Low-latency, high-throughput bots built to capture profitable opportunities in fast-paced markets.

- **Math and quantum physics:**  
  - [numb.rs](https://github.com/iamjakkie/numb.rs)
    This piece will work as my fundamental crate for quantum-related apps later on. Good refresher on matrix algebra and linear algebra as well. Give it a try with some complicated matrices. Might not be the fastest one out there (yet), but at the moment I strive for being right and cover advanced topics.
